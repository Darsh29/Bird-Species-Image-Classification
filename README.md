# Bird-Species-Image-Classification
This project focuses on developing an advanced deep learning-based system to accurately classify bird species from images. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 89,885 images labeled across 100 bird species, we implemented and compared multiple model architectures to achieve high classification performance.

Key Features:
Model Development: Designed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by the VGG-16 architecture, and implemented transfer learning using the InceptionV3 model.
Data Augmentation: Employed extensive data augmentation techniques, including 30-degree rotations, horizontal flipping, brightness adjustments, width/height shifts, scaling, and zoom, to enhance model robustness and generalization.
High Accuracy: Achieved a classification accuracy of 90.5% and an F1 score of 90.4% with the Deep CNN model. The InceptionV3 model, utilizing transfer learning, achieved an accuracy of 87.5% and an F1 score of 85.5%.
Efficiency: Demonstrated significant reduction in training time with transfer learning, making the model more efficient while maintaining high accuracy.
Dataset: Utilized an open-source dataset with a Creative Commons license, ensuring the project's accessibility and reproducibility.
This project showcases the potential of deep learning techniques in automating and enhancing the process of bird species identification, contributing significantly to conservation efforts by providing an efficient and accurate tool for scientists, government agencies, and the public.
