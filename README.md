# Bird-Species-Image-Classification
This project uses deep learning to classify bird species from 89,885 images. We developed a Deep CNN inspired by VGG-16 and used InceptionV3 for transfer learning, achieving 90.5% and 87.5% accuracy, respectively. Data augmentation techniques enhanced robustness. This tool aids conservation efforts with efficient and accurate bird identification
